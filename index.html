  <p>This is a demonstration of how it's possible to combine text and canvas in HTML.  Click on these words.  What you see when clicked is a canvas behind the text that is being drawn on.  If you resize the window, the text will reflow, and the canvas will redraw.  Press "p" toggles a layer split that may help clarify what's happening.</p>
  
  <p>We need some lorem ipsum here, so let's talk about our course...</p>
